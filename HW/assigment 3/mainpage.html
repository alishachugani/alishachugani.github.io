        <p>Throughout my childhood, I have taken several different art related clases including, drawings and painting techniques.I began sculpture classes in Taller Quimera where I took an interest to pursue kiln glass sculptures. <br>
          <br>
On July 2013, I completed various courses conducted by Bullseye Glass Co. in Portland, Oregon, mostly in kiln glass and painting with glass.<br>
<br>
I have participated in the first biennial of the South in Panama 2013,
Throughout these last years, I have had presence in many important collective art exhibitions in Panama, Bogota Miami and in New York. <br>
<br>
On december 6th, 2017, had an Individual showing of kiln formed and kiln glass sculptures in Panama.<br>
<br>
My art is oriented to an inherited cultural remembrance. My work represents my individual  spiritual search where I  strive to  connect with myself and the universe. <br>
<br>
I like to visualize the outcome of the final piece, but there is always a surprise element at the end of the firing, where the kilm works its magic in the blending of the glass.  <br></p>
